# SmallProjects
---
### Introduction:
This repository contains small projects that I have made. The main purpose of this repository is to backup and catalog these projects for my own purposes. As such, this repository will always be expanding.

Projects in this repo are organized by their (primary) technology. For example, there is a C++ folder that contains projects made in C++. Each project has its own README.

### Technologies:
* C++
* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks (These are also python, but I will keep them seperate)
* C#
* Web Applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MYSQL, etc.)
