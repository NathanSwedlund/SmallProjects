# Word Warp Solver
---
### Introduction:
This project is designed to give the answers to a rather old iPhone app called Word Warp. The basic premise is this. Make all the words you can given a list of 6 characters, you progress to the next round if you create the six letter word. So this program reads in characters and outputs all the english words that can be created from those characters.

The words.txt file I use in this program can be found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
